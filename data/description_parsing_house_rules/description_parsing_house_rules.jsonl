I\u2019m very sorry. \n\nPets and \u201cemotional support\u201d animals will be removed immediately. No warnings. No exceptions. Zero tolerance policy.  \n\nTerms and Conditions under the Airbnb policy:\n \n\u201cHosts are allowed to decline the presence of emotional support animals from a stay or Experience.\u201d\n\nWe are not responsible for any injuries or the safety of any unauthorized animals because it\u2019s against the house rules. Please do not break the house rules. You will be evicted and trespassed from our property.\n\n\nHeath and Safety Concerns regarding Service Animals:\n\nAs a courtesy request, we ask if you wish to bring a service animal be disclosed in advance. Our in-house cleaner is highly allergic. We need to make special arrangements and schedule special deep cleaning services from an alternative source (in advance) because she will not be able to clean or re-enter the home until this is done. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated. We also wish to verify you are not attempting to bring a \u201cemotional support\u201d animal prior to your arrival. This will avoid sudden and immediate eviction if you misrepresent your pet as a Service Animal.\n\nPlease answer the following 2 questions if you haven\u2019t already:\n\n1) Is the assistance animal required because of a disability? \n \n2) What work or task has the animal been trained to perform? \n\n*** IMPORTANT ! NO \u201cEMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS ALLOWED ! ***\n\nOur local laws state it\u2019s an offence to represent a dog as a guide or service dog when it is not. A conviction carries a fine of up to $3,000.\n \nWe have strict guidelines for those who wish to bring their Service Animal.\n \nA Service Animal staying on our property is NOT allowed to be left in the home alone at any time during your stay. This means not even left alone in a crate. You must take the animal with you anytime you leave the house. \n \nThe guest remains liable for any and all damage caused by a Service Animal. \n\nCompensation for any damages caused outside of normal \u201cwear and tear\u201d will be strictly enforced. \n \nYou and your Service Animal will be asked to leave if we discover misrepresentation of a pet as a Service Animal. We will report fraudulent claims of Service Animals to government authorities and will evict the guest(s) without further notice in such cases. If this occurs, there will be no right to a refund.\n \nBelow are some rules so both your stay and other guests after you will be enjoyable and relaxing:\n \n\u2022Your Service Dog may not be left unattended. (Crating and leaving the animal in your absence is not permitted; the animal must accompany you AT ALL TIMES).\n \n\u2022Please provide an advanced copy of your Service Animal rabies vaccine as well as a vaccination record showing all current vaccinations are current throughout your stay.\n \n\u2022Your Service Animal must be on a leash at all times, or under control of verbal or sight commands that they follow at all times.\n \n\u2022We will ask you to remove your Service Animal if the animal is out of control and the animal\u2019s handler does not take effective action to control it or if the animal is not housebroken. \n \n\u2022Please walk your Service Animal for bathroom needs. Indoor piddle pads are not allowed. \n \n\u2022Please clean up urinations/defecations immediately. Bring your own baggies and dispose in the large green trash cans OUTSIDE \n \n\u2022Service Animals may not be on furniture (sofa, chairs, bed or counters unless it is specifically needed for your disability.\n\n\u2022We are exempt from allowing \u201cemotional support\u201d animals! The tenant must possess documentation from a licensed health care practitioner stating the animal is required.\n\nAll owners should understand that a mere certificate, ID or registration bought online will not be enough to properly qualify their animal companion as service animal.\n\nAt check-out, a walk through will be done to ensure pets have not urinated or defecated in the home (clean it up if they have).  Even the best pets/animals get nervous away from home. Any excrement/urine/stain/damage left will result in forfeiture of deposit.\n\n* Service Animals. Exceptions can be made on the condition that a $5,000 damage deposit + $5,000 cleaning fee applies. This covers the cost of replacing all the furniture in the house and conducting a \u201cdeep clean\u201d of our house. We welcome all people, but this is a private home and not a commercial hotel. We reserve the right to change additional money for cleaning fees to compensate us for potential damage and odor removal. \n\n* We kindly ask to be a little bit more quiet late at night when using the kitchen or watching TV after 10:30 PM.  Other guests in the house might be sleeping at night...zzz Thank you kindly!\n\n* We guarantee our homes are sparking clean. If you are unhappy for any reason, please let us know. We promise to fix it. We wish you a happy and comfortable stay."]}

If the key set is lost, or is not returned by the designated check out time of 11AM on the last day of their confirmed reservation - that the guest will be responsible for a key fob, front door lock and key sets replacement fee of $400. \nI do apologize that this fee is so high, but I will explain: Key fobs are electronically programmed, and if they aren't returned the building management needs to deactivate them, order and program a new one. This can take several days to a week to receive, and it disrupts access for our next guests. Door locks may need to be changed, and new keys need to be cut. This all takes hours of time to do - so please keep the keys safe during your time at the apartment, and return them at the end.\n\n2 - Linens & Towels. \nGuests agree to be mindful with makeup during their stay, and not to stain bedsheets or towels with makeup or blood. If unremovable stains are found after check out, guests agree they will be responsible for the replacement costs for new towels or linens. \n\n3 - Check out time. \nCheck out time is 11AM on the final day of your confirmed reservation. By this time, the guest agrees they will be completely checked out of the Air Bnb unit unless there has been a previous mutually agreed upon check out time between the guest and the host written with permission to do so by the host or the cleaning coordinator in the message thread.\nA late check out fee of $100 will be charged to the guest Air Bnb's resolution request for any guests who fail to check out on time without having previous permission to do so.\n\n3 - Air Bnb Booking \nYour booking is exclusively between Host, Host's Cleaner & Assistant and Guest. Guests acknowledge by confirming their booking that they are not to discuss Air Bnb with anyone at the building during their stay. This building allows Air Bnb, but if a guest requests assistance from building staff such as security or the manager it reflects poorly on Air Bnb hosting in the building. This is a private and residential building first, and Air Bnb stays are to be conducted between the host and guests only. Instances of guests bothering building staff are not looked upon favorably, and do not help us with our petitions to be able to continue to Air Bnb in the building. Please be respectful, and keep your stay private and only communicate with your host about it and no one else.\n\n4 - Parkade Access - When Entering & Exiting the Parkade:\nThis building carries a specific rule regarding entering and exiting the parkade. All vehicles entering or exiting the primary and main parkade gate must stop and wait for the gate to close behind them before proceeding. This rule is in place to help residents and visitors assist in vigilance against theives gaining access to the parkade, which puts everyones vehicles inside at risk. The building enforces this rule with a $200 fine, that will be sent to the owner of the key set used to access the parkade alone with time/date and photos of the occurence. If one of these fines is incurred during your stay, it will be requested through Air Bnb and the guest will be required to reimburse it.\n\n5 - Absolutely no smoking inside of the unit!\nIf evidence of smoking is found inside of the unit, a fine of $500 will be charged to the guest via Air Bnb's resolution request to cover professional smoke and odour removal services."], "before_you_leave_house_rule": ["Return keys"]}

If the key set is lost, or is not returned by the designated check out time of 10AM on the last day of their confirmed reservation - that the guest will be responsible for a key fob, front door lock and key sets replacement fee of $500. \nI do apologize that this fee is so high, but I will explain: Key fobs are electronically programmed, and if they aren't returned the building management needs to deactivate them, order and program a new one. This can take several days to a week to receive, and it disrupts access for our next guests. Door locks may need to be changed, and new keys need to be cut.

Guests acknowledge by confirming their booking that they are not to discuss Air Bnb with anyone at the building during their stay. This building allows Air Bnb, but if a guest requests assistance from building staff such as security or the manager it reflects poorly on Air Bnb hosting in the building. This is a private and residential building first, and Air Bnb stays are to be conducted between the host and guests only. Instances of guests bothering building staff are not looked upon favorably, and do not help us with our petitions to be able to continue to Air Bnb in the building. Please be respectful, and keep your stay private and only communicate with your host about it and no one else.\n\n4 - Parkade Access - When Entering & Exiting the Parkade:\nThis building carries a specific rule regarding entering and exiting the parkade. All vehicles entering or exiting the primary and main parkade gate must stop and wait for the gate to close behind them before proceeding. This rule is in place to help residents and visitors assist in vigilance against theives gaining access to the parkade, which puts everyones vehicles inside at risk. The building enforces this rule with a $200 fine, that will be sent to the owner of the key set used to access the parkade alone with time/date and photos of the occurence. If one of these fines is incurred during your stay, it will be requested through Air Bnb and the guest will be required to reimburse it.\n\n5 - Absolutely no smoking inside of the unit!\nIf evidence of smoking is found inside of the unit, a fine of $500 will be charged to the guest via Air Bnb's resolution request to cover professional smoke and odour removal services."], "before_you_leave_house_rule": ["Return keys"]}

Just clarifying- some guests like a hands on approach with hosts and want lots of communication. Others want zero communication and to be left entirely on their own\u2026. Just as we ask you to respect our property, we too want to respect your space and time. When you arrive, it is self check in only. We will leave you to it, however we are always just a text or message away, & should you have questions, please don\u2019t hesitate!  We are usually not that far away and are more than happy to answer any questions you may have.     House Rules:  We have a strict no smoking policy / no VAPE-ing on or around the property as one of us is allergic to tobacco.   When it\u2019s hot out, we have our air conditioning on which requires all the windows to remain closed, but if you are too cold, open the windows and/ or let us know there is a temp. issue.  We keep the downstairs vents closed as it\u2019s usually several degrees cooler downstairs to begin with, but some of the cool air will still get into the suite.  We ask that you please respect our close neighbours and enter and exit our property QUIETLY, MOST especially for early morning check outs and late check ins!  Please advise if you are bringing a car and you can use our car port.  We have no bathtub and the house is not baby-proofed, so please be aware of this before booking if you bringing small children. House parties are not allowed, and quiet hours will be after 10pm, please. (this includes use of the surround sound).  Due to the air-tight nature of the shower stall, we request that after use the wet glass be squeegeed and shower door left open with the fan on to allow it to dry and remain mildew-free for everyone's health and cleanliness.  Failure to do so will incur an additional cleaning fee. Just a heads up--the breaker box for the entire house is located in the kitchen and should we trip a breaker, we will need to enter to reset it, and will knock first of course! Long term guests only: Our laundry facilities are located in the suite, so we would like to work a time to use our washer and dryer at your convenience once per week during your stay. \n\nSince we have very recently renovated, we have a few added house rules.\n1) We are a shoe free home. Please remove your shoes at the door. We have provided a mat for your shoes.\n2) As we have brand new flooring throughout, please refrain from rolling your luggage through the suite. Please lift and place it on either of the 2 luggage racks, taking care of the new paint job.\n3) Please do not cut on the countertops. Use a chopping board.\n4) Please never sit on top of the breakfast bar island.\n(Many thanks in advance for your mindfulness!)\n\n5) We have a few cats who are friendly and may ask to visit. They are welcome to if you wish, but please let them out before you go to bed so they can come upstairs through our cat door. (Mr. Mittens & Squishy are the regular concierges!)"]}

Please do not cook foods that can give a bad smell. We take pride in providing a comfortable home free from any bad smells. \n\nDue to damage cased by animals...\n\nNo pets allowed.\n\nNo \u201cemotional support\u201d animals allowed!\n\nDue to medical reasons (health and safety concerns), we do not allow animals. I\u2019m very sorry. \n\nPets and \u201cemotional support\u201d animals will be removed immediately. No warnings. No exceptions. Zero tolerance policy.  \n\nTerms and Conditions under the Airbnb policy:\n \n\u201cHosts are allowed to decline the presence of emotional support animals from a stay or Experience.\u201d\n\nWe are not responsible for any injuries or the safety of any unauthorized animals because it\u2019s against the house rules. Please do not break the house rules. You will be evicted and trespassed from our property.\n\n\nHeath and Safety Concerns regarding Service Animals:\n\nAs a courtesy request, we ask if you wish to bring a service animal be disclosed in advance. Our in-house cleaner is highly allergic. We need to make special arrangements and schedule special deep cleaning services from an alternative source (in advance) because she will not be able to clean or re-enter the home until this is done. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated. We also wish to verify you are not attempting to bring a \u201cemotional support\u201d animal prior to your arrival. This will avoid sudden and immediate eviction if you misrepresent your pet as a Service Animal.\n\nPlease answer the following 2 questions if you haven\u2019t already:\n\n1) Is the assistance animal required because of a disability? \n \n2) What work or task has the animal been trained to perform? \n\n*** IMPORTANT ! NO \u201cEMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS ALLOWED ! ***\n\nOur local laws state it\u2019s an offence to represent a dog as a guide or service dog when it is not. A conviction carries a fine of up to $3,000\n\n \nWe have strict guidelines for those who wish to bring their Service Animal.\n \nA Service Animal staying on our property is NOT allowed to be left in the home alone at any time during your stay. This means not even left alone in a crate. You must take the animal with you anytime you leave the house. \n \nThe guest remains liable for any and all damage caused by a Service Animal. \n\nCompensation for any damages caused outside of normal \u201cwear and tear\u201d will be strictly enforced. \n \nYou and your Service Animal will be asked to leave if we discover misrepresentation of a pet as a Service Animal. We will report fraudulent claims of Service Animals to government authorities and will evict the guest(s) without further notice in such cases. If this occurs, there will be no right to a refund.\n \nBelow are some rules so both your stay and other guests after you will be enjoyable and relaxing:\n \n\u2022Your Service Dog may not be left unattended. (Crating and leaving the animal in your absence is not permitted; the animal must accompany you AT ALL TIMES).\n \n\u2022Please provide an advanced copy of your Service Animal rabies vaccine as well as a vaccination record showing all current vaccinations are current throughout your stay.\n \n\u2022Your Service Animal must be on a leash at all times, or under control of verbal or sight commands that they follow at all times.\n \n\u2022We will ask you to remove your Service Animal if the animal is out of control and the animal\u2019s handler does not take effective action to control it or if the animal is not housebroken. \n \n\u2022Please walk your Service Animal for bathroom needs. Indoor piddle pads are not allowed. \n \n\u2022Please clean up urinations/defecations immediately. Bring your own baggies and dispose in the large green trash cans OUTSIDE \n \n\u2022Service Animals may not be on furniture (sofa, chairs, bed or counters unless it is specifically needed for your disability.\n\n\u2022We are exempt from allowing \u201cemotional support\u201d animals! The tenant must possess documentation from a licensed health care practitioner stating the animal is required.\n\nAll owners should understand that a mere certificate, ID or registration bought online will not be enough to properly qualify their animal companion as service animal.\n\nAt check-out, a walk through will be done to ensure pets have not urinated or defecated in the home (clean it up if they have).  Even the best pets/animals get nervous away from home. Any excrement/urine/stain/damage left will result in forfeiture of deposit.\n\n* Emotional Support Animal exceptions can be made on the condition that a $5,000 damage deposit + $5,000 cleaning fee applies. This covers the cost of replacing all the furniture in the house and conducting a \u201cdeep clean\u201d of our house. We welcome all people, but this is a private home and not a commercial hotel. We reserve the right to change additional money for cleaning fees to compensate us for potential damage and odor removal. \n\n* We guarantee our homes are sparking clean. If you are unhappy for any reason, please let us know. We promise to fix it. We wish you a happy and comfortable stay."]}

Based on past experiences, we do not host groups who are all 21 years of age or younger. If your group is 21 years of age or younger, please do not place a reservation without written pre-approval from us. Failure to do so will result in termination of your reservation.\n\n2. Vancouver locals are not allowed to place a booking without pre-approval from us. This is to prevent locals from using our residence as a party house.\n\n3. Please note that we only release door codes to the person who booked the reservation and you must provide a valid, government-issued photo ID.\n\n4. All guests must be accounted for in the reservation. This means all guests entering the residence/building at any point in time count as guests. In other words, the definition of a guest is not limited to only those people planning on sleeping inside the unit, but to all guests planning to be inside the unit at any given time. For example, if 6 people are going to \u201chang out\u201d inside the unit, but only 2 people plan on sleeping over, then the guest count selected during the booking should be \u201c6\u201d not \u201c2.\u201d Any extra guests not disclosed before arrival will lead to immediate termination of the reservation and a full charge of your damage deposit of $899.\n\n5. No parties/events. There is a caretaker on-site and we have close relationships with our neighbors and we respect their rights as homeowners. Therefore, we will know if parties are being held.  If this rule is not followed, the full security deposit of$899 will be charged and you will be immediately removed from the unit. \n\n6. Not for commercial use or special occasions without pre-approval (weddings, bachelor parties, birthdays, commercials, bridal showers, photoshoots, etc.). We will consider your request if you notify us in advance. Failure to inform us in advance will lead to a termination of your reservation and full charge of your security deposit of $899.\n\n7. Please note that this is a smoke-free/drug-free environment. If any smoking/drugs are detected either within the unit or in the common areas of the building, the full security deposit of $899 will be charged and you will be removed from the unit. \n\n8. All pets must be mentioned before booking and with written approval only. There are additional fees for pets as our professional cleaners charge extra for reservations with pets. A full security deposit of $899 will be charged for any damage caused by pets and if the damage is more than $899, the charge will vary.\n\n9. No excessive noise or loud music. Quiet hours start at 9:00 pm. If any excessive noise complaints are reported by neighbors or caretakers, the full security deposit of $899 will be charged and you will be immediately removed from the unit.\n\n10. Please ensure to check-out on time to avoid a $100 late check-out fee. We need to have our cleaners clean the unit on time for the next guest to check-in on time. If you require an earlier check-in or a later check-out please request it in advance and we will do our best to accommodate you if its possible. Unless otherwise discussed, any guest who is still in the residence after 12 pm will be charged for an extra night. This does not apply if we have approved a late check-out in advance.\n\n11. Guests are assured that the space will be in clean and working condition. No compensation will be given for non-working items outside of our control, including but not limited to, power outages, internet outages, etc. For items inside our control, we will make every attempt to rectify any problems that may occur. It is the Guest\u2019s responsibility to notify us immediately if there are any problems. No refunds or other compensations will be given for problems we can rectify within a reasonable timeframe. Guest will be responsible for costs of any repairs for problems caused by actions of Guest or due to Guest\u2019s failure to immediately notify Host.\n\n12. Guests take full responsibility for any accidents, injuries, or illnesses that occur while on the premises or its facilities. By accepting this reservation, it is agreed that all guests are expressly assuming the risk of any harm arising from their use of the premises. Guests recognize that they may personally purchase insurance to protect themselves in such events.\n\n14.

I\u2019m very sorry. \n\nPets and \u201cemotional support\u201d animals will be removed immediately. No warnings. No exceptions. Zero tolerance policy.  \n\nTerms and Conditions under the Airbnb policy:\n \n\u201cHosts are allowed to decline the presence of emotional support animals from a stay or Experience.\u201d\n\nWe are not responsible for any injuries or the safety of any unauthorized animals because it\u2019s against the house rules. Please do not break the house rules. You will be evicted and trespassed from our property.\n\n\nHeath and Safety Concerns regarding Service Animals:\n\nAs a courtesy request, we ask if you wish to bring a service animal be disclosed in advance. Our in-house cleaner is highly allergic. We need to make special arrangements and schedule special deep cleaning services from an alternative source (in advance) because she will not be able to clean or re-enter the home until this is done. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated. We also wish to verify you are not attempting to bring a \u201cemotional support\u201d animal prior to your arrival. This will avoid sudden and immediate eviction if you misrepresent your pet as a Service Animal.\n\nPlease answer the following 2 questions if you haven\u2019t already:\n\n1) Is the assistance animal required because of a disability? \n \n2) What work or task has the animal been trained to perform? \n\n*** IMPORTANT ! NO \u201cEMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS ALLOWED ! ***\n\nOur local laws state it\u2019s an offence to represent a dog as a guide or service dog when it is not. A conviction carries a fine of up to $3,000\n\n \nWe have strict guidelines for those who wish to bring their Service Animal.\n \nA Service Animal staying on our property is NOT allowed to be left in the home alone at any time during your stay. This means not even left alone in a crate. You must take the animal with you anytime you leave the house. \n \nThe guest remains liable for any and all damage caused by a Service Animal. \n\nCompensation for any damages caused outside of normal \u201cwear and tear\u201d will be strictly enforced. \n \nYou and your Service Animal will be asked to leave if we discover misrepresentation of a pet as a Service Animal. We will report fraudulent claims of Service Animals to government authorities and will evict the guest(s) without further notice in such cases. If this occurs, there will be no right to a refund.\n \nBelow are some rules so both your stay and other guests after you will be enjoyable and relaxing:\n \n\u2022Your Service Dog may not be left unattended. (Crating and leaving the animal in your absence is not permitted; the animal must accompany you AT ALL TIMES).\n \n\u2022Please provide an advanced copy of your Service Animal rabies vaccine as well as a vaccination record showing all current vaccinations are current throughout your stay.\n \n\u2022Your Service Animal must be on a leash at all times, or under control of verbal or sight commands that they follow at all times.\n \n\u2022We will ask you to remove your Service Animal if the animal is out of control and the animal\u2019s handler does not take effective action to control it or if the animal is not housebroken. \n \n\u2022Please walk your Service Animal for bathroom needs. Indoor piddle pads are not allowed. \n \n\u2022Please clean up urinations/defecations immediately. Bring your own baggies and dispose in the large green trash cans OUTSIDE \n \n\u2022Service Animals may not be on furniture (sofa, chairs, bed or counters unless it is specifically needed for your disability.\n\n\u2022We are exempt from allowing \u201cemotional support\u201d animals! The tenant must possess documentation from a licensed health care practitioner stating the animal is required.\n\nAll owners should understand that a mere certificate, ID or registration bought online will not be enough to properly qualify their animal companion as service animal.\n\nAt check-out, a walk through will be done to ensure pets have not urinated or defecated in the home (clean it up if they have).  Even the best pets/animals get nervous away from home. Any excrement/urine/stain/damage left will result in forfeiture of deposit.\n\n* Service Animals. Exceptions can be made on the condition that a $5,000 damage deposit + $5,000 cleaning fee applies. This covers the cost of replacing all the furniture in the house and conducting a \u201cdeep clean\u201d of our house. We welcome all people, but this is a private home and not a commercial hotel. We reserve the right to change additional money for cleaning fees to compensate us for potential damage and odor removal. \n\n* We kindly ask to be a little bit more quiet late at night when using the kitchen or watching TV after 10:30 PM.

I\u2019m very sorry. \n\nPets and \u201cemotional support\u201d animals will be removed immediately. No warnings. No exceptions. Zero tolerance policy.  \n\nTerms and Conditions under the Airbnb policy:\n \n\u201cHosts are allowed to decline the presence of emotional support animals from a stay or Experience.\u201d\n\nWe are not responsible for any injuries or the safety of any unauthorized animals because it\u2019s against the house rules. Please do not break the house rules. You will be evicted and trespassed from our property.\n\n\nHeath and Safety Concerns regarding Service Animals:\n\nAs a courtesy request, we ask if you wish to bring a service animal be disclosed in advance. Our in-house cleaner is highly allergic. We need to make special arrangements and schedule special deep cleaning services from an alternative source (in advance) because she will not be able to clean or re-enter the home until this is done. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated. We also wish to verify you are not attempting to bring a \u201cemotional support\u201d animal prior to your arrival. This will avoid sudden and immediate eviction if you misrepresent your pet as a Service Animal.\n\nPlease answer the following 2 questions if you haven\u2019t already:\n\n1) Is the assistance animal required because of a disability? \n \n2) What work or task has the animal been trained to perform? \n\n*** IMPORTANT ! NO \u201cEMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS ALLOWED ! ***\n\nOur local laws state it\u2019s an offence to represent a dog as a guide or service dog when it is not. A conviction carries a fine of up to $3,000\n \nWe have strict guidelines for those who wish to bring their Service Animal.\n \nA Service Animal staying on our property is NOT allowed to be left in the home alone at any time during your stay. This means not even left alone in a crate. You must take the animal with you anytime you leave the house. \n \nThe guest remains liable for any and all damage caused by a Service Animal. \n\nCompensation for any damages caused outside of normal \u201cwear and tear\u201d will be strictly enforced. \n \nYou and your Service Animal will be asked to leave if we discover misrepresentation of a pet as a Service Animal. We will report fraudulent claims of Service Animals to government authorities and will evict the guest(s) without further notice in such cases. If this occurs, there will be no right to a refund.\n \nBelow are some rules so both your stay and other guests after you will be enjoyable and relaxing:\n \n\u2022Your Service Dog may not be left unattended. (Crating and leaving the animal in your absence is not permitted; the animal must accompany you AT ALL TIMES).\n \n\u2022Please provide an advanced copy of your Service Animal rabies vaccine as well as a vaccination record showing all current vaccinations are current throughout your stay.\n \n\u2022Your Service Animal must be on a leash at all times, or under control of verbal or sight commands that they follow at all times.\n \n\u2022We will ask you to remove your Service Animal if the animal is out of control and the animal\u2019s handler does not take effective action to control it or if the animal is not housebroken. \n \n\u2022Please walk your Service Animal for bathroom needs. Indoor piddle pads are not allowed. \n \n\u2022Please clean up urinations/defecations immediately. Bring your own baggies and dispose in the large green trash cans OUTSIDE \n \n\u2022Service Animals may not be on furniture (sofa, chairs, bed or counters unless it is specifically needed for your disability.\n\n\u2022We are exempt from allowing \u201cemotional support\u201d animals! The tenant must possess documentation from a licensed health care practitioner stating the animal is required.\n\nAll owners should understand that a mere certificate, ID or registration bought online will not be enough to properly qualify their animal companion as service animal.\n\nAt check-out, a walk through will be done to ensure pets have not urinated or defecated in the home (clean it up if they have).  Even the best pets/animals get nervous away from home. Any excrement/urine/stain/damage left will result in forfeiture of deposit.\n\n* Service Animals. Exceptions can be made on the condition that a $5,000 damage deposit + $5,000 cleaning fee applies. This covers the cost of replacing all the furniture in the house and conducting a \u201cdeep clean\u201d of our house. We welcome all people, but this is a private home and not a commercial hotel. We reserve the right to change additional money for cleaning fees to compensate us for potential damage and odor removal. \n\n* We kindly ask to be a little bit more quiet late at night when using the kitchen or watching TV after 10:30 PM.  Other guests in the house might be sleeping at night...zzz Thank you kindly!\n\n* We guarantee our homes are sparking clean. If you are unhappy for any reason, please let us know.

Just clarifying- some guests like a hands on approach with hosts and want lots of communication. Others want zero communication and to be left entirely on their own\u2026. Just as we ask you to respect our property, we too want to respect your space and time. When you arrive, it is self check in only. We will leave you to it, however we are always just a text or message away, & should you have questions, please don\u2019t hesitate!  We are usually not that far away and are more than happy to answer any questions you may have.     House Rules:  We have a strict no smoking policy / no VAPE-ing on or around the property as one of us is allergic to tobacco.   When it\u2019s hot out, we have our air conditioning on which requires all the windows to remain closed, but if you are too cold, open the windows and/ or let us know there is a temp. issue.  We keep the downstairs vents closed as it\u2019s usually several degrees cooler downstairs to begin with, but some of the cool air will still get into the suite.  We ask that you please respect our close neighbours and enter and exit our property QUIETLY, MOST especially for early morning check outs and late check ins!  Please advise if you are bringing a car and you can use our car port.  We have no bathtub and the house is not baby-proofed, so please be aware of this before booking if you bringing small children. House parties are not allowed, and quiet hours will be after 10pm, please. (this includes use of the surround sound).  Due to the air-tight nature of the shower stall, we request that after use the wet glass be squeegeed and shower door left open with the fan on to allow it to dry and remain mildew-free for everyone's health and cleanliness.  Failure to do so will incur an additional cleaning fee. Just a heads up--the breaker box for the entire house is located in the kitchen and should we trip a breaker, we will need to enter to reset it, and will knock first of course! Long term guests only: Our laundry facilities are located in the suite, so we would like to work a time to use our washer and dryer at your convenience once per week during your stay. \n\nSince we have very recently renovated, we have a few added house rules.\n1) We are a shoe free home. Please remove your shoes at the door. We have provided a mat for your shoes.\n2) As we have brand new flooring throughout, please refrain from rolling your luggage through the suite. Please lift and place it on either of the 2 luggage racks, taking care of the new paint job.\n3) Please do not cut on the countertops. Use a chopping board.\n4) Please never sit on top of the breakfast bar island.\n(Many thanks in advance for your mindfulness!)\n\n5) We have a few cats who are friendly and may ask to visit. They are welcome to if you wish, but please let them out before you go to bed so they can come upstairs through our cat door. (Mr. Mittens & Squishy are the regular concierges!)"]}

If the key set is lost, or is not returned by the designated check out time of 10AM on the last day of their confirmed reservation - that the guest will be responsible for a key fob, front door lock and key sets replacement fee of $500. \nI do apologize that this fee is so high, but I will explain: Key fobs are electronically programmed, and if they aren't returned the building management needs to deactivate them, order and program a new one. This can take several days to a week to receive, and it disrupts access for our next guests. Door locks may need to be changed, and new keys need to be cut. This all takes hours of time to do - so please keep the keys safe during your time at the apartment, and return them at the end.\n\n2 - Linens & Towels. \nGuests agree to be mindful with makeup during their stay, and not to stain bedsheets or towels with makeup or blood. If unremovable stains are found after check out, guests agree they will be responsible for the replacement costs for new towels or linens. \n\n3 - Check out time. \nCheck out time is 10AM on the final day of your confirmed reservation. By this time, the guest agrees they will be completely checked out of the Air Bnb unit unless they have confirmed in the message thread with the Host/Coordinator to extend their checkout past this time\n\n3 - Air Bnb Booking \nYour booking is exclusively between Host, Host's Cleaner & Assistant and Guest. Guests acknowledge by confirming their booking that they are not to discuss Air Bnb with anyone at the building during their stay. This building allows Air Bnb, but if a guest requests assistance from building staff such as security or the manager it reflects poorly on Air Bnb hosting in the building. This is a private and residential building first, and Air Bnb stays are to be conducted between the host and guests only. Instances of guests bothering building staff are not looked upon favorably, and do not help us with our petitions to be able to continue to Air Bnb in the building. Please be respectful, and keep your stay private and only communicate with your host about it and no one else.\n\n4 - Parkade Access - When Entering & Exiting the Parkade:\nThis building carries a specific rule regarding entering and exiting the parkade. All vehicles entering or exiting the primary and main parkade gate must stop and wait for the gate to close behind them before proceeding. This rule is in place to help residents and visitors assist in vigilance against theives gaining access to the parkade, which puts everyones vehicles inside at risk. The building enforces this rule with a $200 fine, that will be sent to the owner of the key set used to access the parkade alone with time/date and photos of the occurence. If one of these fines is incurred during your stay, it will be requested through Air Bnb and the guest will be required to reimburse it.\n\n5 - Absolutely no smoking inside of the unit!\nIf evidence of smoking is found inside of the unit, a fine of $500 will be charged to the guest via Air Bnb's resolution request to cover professional smoke and odour removal services."], "before_you_leave_house_rule": ["Return keys"]}

No shoes in home (I provide slipper if you want to use)\n\n3. Important Notice for Guests:\n\nBefore proceeding with your booking, I kindly ask you to read and consider the following context and guidelines for your stay:\n\nLocal Sensitivities: Our building has explicitly stated a policy against Airbnb and other short-term rentals, signified by a sign at the entrance. Violating this policy could result in significant fines for me. I understand and regret that this goes against the building's rules, but I believe not all rules are equally justifiable or applicable to every situation.\n\nPersonal Context:\n\nCost of Living: Vancouver is known for its high cost of living and property prices. With rising strata fees and owning a home with a spare room, I feel it's reasonable to make use of this space. My guests are treated as friends visiting, rather than customers, which aligns with the personal nature of my home.\nSocial and Cultural Benefits: Hosting on Airbnb offers me a valuable opportunity to meet people from various backgrounds, enriching my social life and understanding of different cultures. The joy and learning from these interactions are irreplaceable.\n\nSafety and Respect: My experience with hosting has shown that Airbnb guests are generally polite and respectful. Concerns about safety or disturbances are unfounded based on my positive experiences.\n\nGuidelines for Guests:\n\nDiscretion: To maintain privacy and respect the building's policy, please use the back parking lot entrance when possible, especially when carrying luggage. The front lobby is more visible and monitored by concierge services.\n\nInteraction: Avoid discussing your booking's nature with neighbors or the concierge. If asked, simply state you are visiting friends. This approach minimizes attention and aligns with the community's expectations.\n\nYour understanding and cooperation are greatly appreciated. These measures are in place to ensure a harmonious stay for everyone involved. If you are uncomfortable with these conditions or disagree with the approach, I respectfully ask that you consider other accommodations. Reporting my listing harms not only my family but also deprives others of a peaceful and affordable place to stay. Let's support each other in fostering positive experiences and understanding."]}

Based on past experiences, I do not host groups who are all 21 years of age or younger. If your group is 21 years of age or younger, please do not place a reservation without pre-approval from me. Failure to do so will result in termination of your reservation and no refund. \n\n2. Vancouver locals are not allowed to place a booking without pre-approval from me--this is to prevent locals from using my residence as a party house.\n\n3. Please note that I only hand keys/provide access to the person who booked the reservation and you must show valid picture ID upon request. \n\n4. All guests must be accounted for in the reservation. This means all guests entering the residence/building at any point in time counts as a guest--in other words, the definition of a guest is not limited to only those people planning on sleeping inside the unit, but to all guests planning to be inside the unit at any given time.\n\nFor example, if 8 people are going to \"hang out\" inside the unit, but only 2 people plan on sleeping over, then the guest count selected during the booking should be \"8\" not \"2\". Any extra guests not disclosed before arrival will lead to an immediate termination of the reservation and full charge of a damage deposit.\n\n5. Strictly NO parties/events/loud music. If this rule is not followed, you will be immediately removed from the unit and charged a $1000+ fee. \n\n6. Not for commercial use or special occasions without pre-approval (weddings, bachelor parties, birthdays, commercials, bridal showers, photo shoots, etc.). I will consider your request if you notify me in advance. Failure to inform me in advance will lead to a termination of your reservation. \n\n7. Please note that this is a smoke-free/drug free environment. If any smoking/drugs are detected either within the unit or in the common areas of the building, a minimum of $1000 will be charged and you will be removed from the unit without refund. (We have smoke detectors installed in the unit).\n\n8. No pets please. If any pets are brought inside the unit, the full damage deposit of $1000 will be charged to you. \n\n9. No excessive noise or loud music. Quiet hours start at 10:00pm. If any noise complaints are reported by neighbours or building management more than two times, a full security deposit of $1000 will be charged and you will be immediately removed from the unit without refund. \n\n10. Please ensure to check-out on time in order to avoid a $100 late check-out fee--I need to have my cleaners clean the unit on time for the next guest to check-in. If you require an earlier check-in or a later check-out please request it in advance and I will do my best to accommodate you. Unless otherwise discussed, any guest who is still in the residence/building after 11pm will be charged for an extra $50 per hour. This does not apply if I have approved a late check-out in advance.\n\n11. Late check in time: Please let me know if you need to check-in past 10pm in advance.\n\n12. Guests take full responsibility for any accidents, injuries, or illnesses that occur while on the premises or its facilities.

With respect, most people in this area live here for the fresh air, so smoking is generally not appreciated in the neighbourhood.  Additionally, this is a forested area that can be very dry in summer, so smoking outdoors is often prohibited on trails in summer.\n\nThe use, manufacture or sale of illegal drugs shall result in immediate termination of guest's stay.\n\nQuiet Neighborhood:\nWe like people to enjoy themselves and have fun, but this is NOT a party house or a party neighborhood.  There is no provision for additional guests beyond the maximum two persons indicated in the reservation (maximum two adults).  And, while there are two tandem parking spots for the cottage, there is no additional street parking in the neighborhood.  Guests who have stayed here tend to love the outdoors and appreciate the quiet.  General quiet in the neighborhood is observed  10 pm - 7:30 am.  Outdoor dining, chatting, etc. should be taken inside by 10 pm.  Be aware that sound travels easily in such a quiet area if windows are left open.\n\nGarbage and recycling:\nIt is extremely important that you do not leave garbage or recycling outside on the deck.  Bears are active in the area, but we prefer them at a distance.  If you are staying less than 3 days, just leave garbage in the cottage.  If you are staying more than three days, use the garbage fob on the wall above the bookshelf to take your garbage to the waste and recycling facility (located just above cabin off of Bedwell Bay Rd.).  We sort for 1) garbage, 2) kitchen waste and 3) plastics, cans, paper.  \n\nFragrant cooking:  \nPlease cook fish, seafood or very fragrant foods on the bbq outside.  No deep frying, inside or outside, please.\n\nCars:\nLock your cars and do not leave food inside cars.  We have no theft problems here, but bears have been known to enter vehicles.\n\nAppliances:\nPlease note if you use washer/dryer the closet door must remain open.  Dryer will overheat if door is closed. \n\nAC:  \nIf using AC in bedroom, please do not set AC lower than 20C.  Start AC just before bedtime and ensure bedroom door is closed whenever unit is in use. Bedroom will cool within 10-15 minutes.  Shut off AC when not using bedroom.\n\nHeating:  If using gas fireplace, electric baseboards or AC, the expectation is that the doors and windows are closed.  \n\nBBQ:  \nPlease use bbq scraper on grills after use and turn off gas at tank.\n\nSeptic:  \nWe are on a septic system.  As such, it is critical that due care is taken to ensure simple rules regarding septic are followed.   Only human waste and toilet paper go down the toilet.  Please no feminine hygiene, condoms, wet wipes, food, etc. in toilet.  \n\nHair dyeing and hair cutting:\nSounds strange, but please do not do either of these activities in cottage.\n\nMake up removal:\nPlease use make up removal cloths instead of towels and bedding to remove make up. \n\nCleaning:  \nUpon check out, we ask guests to leave cottage roughly as you found it.  Just please ensure dishes have been washed (ok to start dishwasher on your way out).

You can of course watch late-night TV even at higher volumes, just be reasonable about it (there are concrete floors in the house to keep the noise down, so that helps and we generally cannot hear anything at all through the concrete floors).\n\nPlease be respectful to the property and prevent damage.  Please report damage or items needing fixing promptly so that I can arrange repairs as I want you to have a 5-star experience and for other guests after you.  Please use only marble/granite cleaner on the marble table and please use drink coasters provided, otherwise it will get damaged, thanks!  If you need supplies, please ask!\n\nBBQ use only for those competent with propane.  If you need help, I'd rather you ask and I will be very glad to help you do it right!  Please clean the grill and prep areas after cooking so that any grease doesn't set in - there is a brush and BBQ wipes provided.  Please let the BBQ cool before you flip the sides closed or put a cover on it, thanks.\n\nThe hosts have access to the rear garden and pathways and carport for garage access, yard maintenance, garbage/recycling and snow removal.  We will de-ice your stairs and pathway in winter.  If you need to get rid of some garbage, please ask and I will handle it, rather than have it be an odour problem for your stay.\n\nThe host has a piano and may play classical music during afternoons, generally when guests aren't around or on unbooked days.  Nonetheless, should afternoon piano noise disturb you, please message and I will ensure you peace and quiet during your stay.  Don't hesitate to reach out - I understand some travellers have conference calls, afternoon naps, etc.\n\nThe hosts generally do not accept bookings from new accounts or those with no recent positive reviews - this is strict when the hosts are planning to be away for any portion of a potential requested booking.  \n\nIf you are a new account or have no recent reviews, please provide sufficient detail in your booking request as you are asking us to trust an unknown with our property that receives great care and we will need to consider if we are a good fit for your request.\n\nBooking modifications or alterations are subject to the same terms as the original cancellation policy - i.e. a modification or alteration request does not reset/shift/void the original cancellation window.\n\nThe no-smoking / no vapours / no parties / no events / no gatherings / no pets / no unregistered guest rules are strict and an additional $250 cleaning fee will apply should any of these rules be broken, along with the cancellation of the remaining booking with no refunds and all guests will be required to leave the property immediately.\n\nAny violation of the house rules or substantive damage to the property by you, your guests, or your invitees - including unallowed third-party bookings or undeclared visitors, are grounds for immediate cancellation of your reservation and removal of everyone from the property with no refunds and application of associated penalty fees.  Further, the booker agrees to be solely responsible for the legal consequences/repairs/penalty fees and overall Airbnb resolution process of any such rule violations or damage caused by themselves and/or any of the aforementioned people, so please be accountable for your guests etc. (i.e., have them understand the rules too).  You agree to reimburse the host for damage beyond normal wear and tear through the Airbnb resolution process.\n\nIf you violate any of the house rules or damage the property, you agree to forfeit your ability to leave a public review through Airbnb or any other platform.

Enjoy yourself and the area while you are here. Please don\u2019t engage with people in the buildiing, let\u2019s respect their privacy. With the neighbourhood - avoid Hastings and Main. It\u2019s best to go right (west) when leaving the building. \n\nDRAPES - VERY IMPORTANT. To open or close, use the extender pole in the broom closet. Please don\u2019t pull on them as it stretches the cable and you may pull the drapes off the wall. Fees would apply. \n\nFLOORS \u2013 please be sure to pick up dropped food, spills, anything wet, etc. They are raw concrete which will stain - you will be charged for damaging floors. They show grey when wiped as they are raw concrete. \n\nTowels/bedding Towels have been left out for you on the tub. Please try to only use these - cleaners don\u2019t have time for additional laundry. Extra fees will be charged for additional towels or bedding. Robes can be used but they take extra time to clean thus charged $50 for use. \n\nFireplace switch. On the wall to the right as you walk in, near the window. Outdoor light is there \u00ad\u2014 please don\u2019t leave on.\n\nFRONT DOOR. Only use the top dead bolt/smart lock. Lock the smart lock by pressing the Yale logo. Do not unplug the white device by the door as the smart lock will stop working. Do not tamper with the smart lock or you will be charged for someone to fix. \n\nDeck Please do not move the furniture. If you need to, put back as it was. If you are in the loft for more than 3 days, please water the plants. Do not move the umbrellas as the cleaners are not strong enough to move back. \n\nCandles There are tea lights for you to use in the black basket by the ottoman. Use the candle holders that are on the tray by the patio.. Please do not burn any other candles. Some are for display and some are for my work. Charges will apply for burning candles (not the tea lights). \n\nHEATING/COOLING. I only use the fireplace for heat. There is an AC unit in the powder room - this needs to be taken to the patio door and put the hose ouside to use. Sometimes the breaker trips. If this happens, the breaker box is by the front door behind the art, be sure the breakers noted are left off. There\u2019s also two Dyson tower fans, you can move these to area you are in.  \n\nnotes on the loft\n: Walls, please don\u2019t scuff or get fingerprints on walls. Extra fees apply if you dirty the walls and windows.\n: Leather furniture. Please be careful with my white leather furniture. It\u2019s delicate. If you spill on them, just use dish soap and warm water.\n: Furniture should not be moved - if it is necssary to move and not put back, extra fees may apply to restyle.\n: Stereo by patio door doesn\u2019t work - it\u2019s just for decor. \n: Fan by front door does not work - it\u2019s just for decor. Please don\u2019t move it. \n\nNOISE_ No parties. No noise after 11:00pm or before 8:00am. Absolutely no partying or pets. The walls are thin so please be mindful of noise. This is my home and it\u2019s important to respect my neighbours.\n\nROOFTOP. Going outside of my rooftop railings is NOT allowed - the building strata is very strict on this. Neighbors can hear footsteps on the roof and will report it. YOU WILL BE FINED AND EVICTED. Rooftop floor has soft spots so please be cautious. \n\nAs per Vancouver bylaws, Airbnb can only be hosted if it is your primary residence thus my personal belongings are in the loft.

They give these very misleading ratings to make guests think 4 stars out of 5 is pretty good but in reality, it's not! \n\nI am a Super Host. We need to get average ratings over 4.8 to retain the title. It's very hard for us to get the 4.8 rating but it could get downgrade really easily. They don't treat us well at all but take a lot from our meagre earnings. \n\nFor example, I got some 4 star ratings for Location. So my overall rating is 4 star because\n\n1. They don't have ratings of 4.5 or 4.8 or anything in between. So the guests could only choose 4 star. That could make me lose my Super Host title for something I have no control and can't do anything to improve it.\n\n2. I could improve anything else but could not change or improve my Location ! \n\nWe have been asking the Airbnb to change location rating system to better reflect the good services of the hosts. But they said that if we describe our location honestly, we should not have problems....\n\nIt's very discouraging and demotivated to us. \n\nSo please rate us with all the factors that I just described above. And please don't rate us according to the luxury hotels criteria. We earn penny of what the hotel charges.\n\nThank you so much for choosing to be my guests!"]}

Please do not break the house rules. You will be evicted and trespassed from our property.\n\n\nHeath and Safety Concerns regarding Service Animals:\n\nAs a courtesy request, we ask if you wish to bring a service animal be disclosed in advance. Our in-house cleaner is highly allergic. We need to make special arrangements and schedule special deep cleaning services from an alternative source (in advance) because she will not be able to clean or re-enter the home until this is done. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated. We also wish to verify you are not attempting to bring a \u201cemotional support\u201d animal prior to your arrival. This will avoid sudden and immediate eviction if you misrepresent your pet as a Service Animal.\n\nPlease answer the following 2 questions if you haven\u2019t already:\n\n1) Is the assistance animal required because of a disability? \n \n2) What work or task has the animal been trained to perform? \n\n*** IMPORTANT ! NO \u201cEMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS ALLOWED ! ***\n\nOur local laws state it\u2019s an offence to represent a dog as a guide or service dog when it is not. A conviction carries a fine of up to $3,000\n\n \nWe have strict guidelines for those who wish to bring their Service Animal.\n \nA Service Animal staying on our property is NOT allowed to be left in the home alone at any time during your stay. This means not even left alone in a crate. You must take the animal with you anytime you leave the house. \n \nThe guest remains liable for any and all damage caused by a Service Animal. \n\nCompensation for any damages caused outside of normal \u201cwear and tear\u201d will be strictly enforced. \n \nYou and your Service Animal will be asked to leave if we discover misrepresentation of a pet as a Service Animal. We will report fraudulent claims of Service Animals to government authorities and will evict the guest(s) without further notice in such cases. If this occurs, there will be no right to a refund.\n \nBelow are some rules so both your stay and other guests after you will be enjoyable and relaxing:\n \n\u2022Your Service Dog may not be left unattended. (Crating and leaving the animal in your absence is not permitted; the animal must accompany you AT ALL TIMES).\n \n\u2022Please provide an advanced copy of your Service Animal rabies vaccine as well as a vaccination record showing all current vaccinations are current throughout your stay.\n \n\u2022Your Service Animal must be on a leash at all times, or under control of verbal or sight commands that they follow at all times.\n \n\u2022We will ask you to remove your Service Animal if the animal is out of control and the animal\u2019s handler does not take effective action to control it or if the animal is not housebroken. \n \n\u2022Please walk your Service Animal for bathroom needs. Indoor piddle pads are not allowed. \n \n\u2022Please clean up urinations/defecations immediately. Bring your own baggies and dispose in the large green trash cans OUTSIDE \n \n\u2022Service Animals may not be on furniture (sofa, chairs, bed or counters unless it is specifically needed for your disability.\n\n\u2022We are exempt from allowing \u201cemotional support\u201d animals! The tenant must possess documentation from a licensed health care practitioner stating the animal is required.\n\nAll owners should understand that a mere certificate, ID or registration bought online will not be enough to properly qualify their animal companion as service animal.\n\nAt check-out, a walk through will be done to ensure pets have not urinated or defecated in the home (clean it up if they have).  Even the best pets/animals get nervous away from home. Any excrement/urine/stain/damage left will result in forfeiture of deposit.\n\n* Emotional Support Animal exceptions can be made on the condition that a $5,000 damage deposit + $5,000 cleaning fee applies. This covers the cost of replacing all the furniture in the house and conducting a \u201cdeep clean\u201d of our house. We welcome all people, but this is a private home and not a commercial hotel. We reserve the right to change additional money for cleaning fees to compensate us for potential damage and odor removal. \n\n* We guarantee our homes are sparking clean. If you are unhappy for any reason, please let us know. We promise to fix it. We wish you a happy and comfortable stay."]}

I\u2019m very sorry. \n\nPets and \u201cemotional support\u201d animals will be removed immediately. No warnings. No exceptions. Zero tolerance policy.  \n\nTerms and Conditions under the Airbnb policy:\n \n\u201cHosts are allowed to decline the presence of emotional support animals from a stay or Experience.\u201d\n\nWe are not responsible for any injuries or the safety of any unauthorized animals because it\u2019s against the house rules. Please do not break the house rules. You will be evicted and trespassed from our property.\n\n\nHeath and Safety Concerns regarding Service Animals:\n\nAs a courtesy request, we ask if you wish to bring a service animal be disclosed in advance. Our in-house cleaner is highly allergic. We need to make special arrangements and schedule special deep cleaning services from an alternative source (in advance) because she will not be able to clean or re-enter the home until this is done. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated. We also wish to verify you are not attempting to bring a \u201cemotional support\u201d animal prior to your arrival. This will avoid sudden and immediate eviction if you misrepresent your pet as a Service Animal.\n\nPlease answer the following 2 questions if you haven\u2019t already:\n\n1) Is the assistance animal required because of a disability? \n \n2) What work or task has the animal been trained to perform? \n\n*** IMPORTANT ! NO \u201cEMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS ALLOWED ! ***\n\nOur local laws state it\u2019s an offence to represent a dog as a guide or service dog when it is not. A conviction carries a fine of up to $3,000\n\n \nWe have strict guidelines for those who wish to bring their Service Animal.\n \nA Service Animal staying on our property is NOT allowed to be left in the home alone at any time during your stay. This means not even left alone in a crate. You must take the animal with you anytime you leave the house. \n \nThe guest remains liable for any and all damage caused by a Service Animal. \n\nCompensation for any damages caused outside of normal \u201cwear and tear\u201d will be strictly enforced. \n \nYou and your Service Animal will be asked to leave if we discover misrepresentation of a pet as a Service Animal. We will report fraudulent claims of Service Animals to government authorities and will evict the guest(s) without further notice in such cases. If this occurs, there will be no right to a refund.\n \nBelow are some rules so both your stay and other guests after you will be enjoyable and relaxing:\n \n\u2022Your Service Dog may not be left unattended. (Crating and leaving the animal in your absence is not permitted; the animal must accompany you AT ALL TIMES).\n \n\u2022Please provide an advanced copy of your Service Animal rabies vaccine as well as a vaccination record showing all current vaccinations are current throughout your stay.\n \n\u2022Your Service Animal must be on a leash at all times, or under control of verbal or sight commands that they follow at all times.\n \n\u2022We will ask you to remove your Service Animal if the animal is out of control and the animal\u2019s handler does not take effective action to control it or if the animal is not housebroken. \n \n\u2022Please walk your Service Animal for bathroom needs. Indoor piddle pads are not allowed. \n \n\u2022Please clean up urinations/defecations immediately. Bring your own baggies and dispose in the large green trash cans OUTSIDE \n \n\u2022Service Animals may not be on furniture (sofa, chairs, bed or counters unless it is specifically needed for your disability.\n\n\u2022We are exempt from allowing \u201cemotional support\u201d animals! The tenant must possess documentation from a licensed health care practitioner stating the animal is required.\n\nAll owners should understand that a mere certificate, ID or registration bought online will not be enough to properly qualify their animal companion as service animal.\n\nAt check-out, a walk through will be done to ensure pets have not urinated or defecated in the home (clean it up if they have).  Even the best pets/animals get nervous away from home. Any excrement/urine/stain/damage left will result in forfeiture of deposit.\n\n* Service Animals. Exceptions can be made on the condition that a $5,000 damage deposit + $5,000 cleaning fee applies. This covers the cost of replacing all the furniture in the house and conducting a \u201cdeep clean\u201d of our house. We welcome all people, but this is a private home and not a commercial hotel. We reserve the right to change additional money for cleaning fees to compensate us for potential damage and odor removal. \n\n* We kindly ask to be a little bit more quiet late at night when using the kitchen or watching TV after 10:30 PM.  Other guests in the house might be sleeping at night...zzz Thank you kindly!\n\n* We guarantee our homes are sparking clean. If you are unhappy for any reason, please let us know.

This includes all Airbnb guests as well. If you throw a party, trash the space, damage the unit, disrespect the property, or have a gathering with extra guests that are not reported in your initial booking, you are breaking the rules and will be fined $200.\n\nCLEANING\nOur cleaning fee is based on a courteous guest (e.g. someone who cleans up after themselves, puts dishes in the dishwasher, towels in the washer, leaves the place as they found it, etc.). This is NOT a hotel. If the housekeeping crew discovers an unreasonable mess post-checkout, we will charge an additional fee of $100.\n\nEXTRA TOWELS/LINENS\nPlease understand and accept that our housekeeping crew needs to cover a great number of units per day and within a short window of time.

They give these very misleading ratings to make guests think 4 stars out of 5 is pretty good but in reality, it's not! \n\nI am a Super Host. We need to get average ratings over 4.8 to retain the title. It's very hard for us to get the 4.8 rating but it could get downgrade really easily. They don't treat us well at all but take a lot from our meagre earnings. \n\nFor example, I got some 4 star ratings for Location. So my overall rating is 4 star because\n\n1. They don't have ratings of 4.5 or 4.8 or anything in between. So the guests could only choose 4 star. That could make me lose my Super Host title for something I have no control and can't do anything to improve it.\n\n2. I could improve anything else but could not change or improve my Location ! \n\nWe have been asking the Airbnb to change location rating system to better reflect the good services of the hosts. But they said that if we describe our location honestly, we should not have problems....\n\nIt's very discouraging and demotivated to us. \n\nSo please rate us with all the factors that I just described above. And please don't rate us according to the luxury hotels criteria. We earn penny of what the hotel charges.\n\nThank you so much for choosing to be my guests!"]}

Our wavier allows us to exclude Service Animals.\n\n* please do not cut or cook / deep fry fish in the house. It leaves an unwelcoming bad smell for the next person. It\u2019s not nice. Please do not cook foods that can give a bad smell. We take pride in providing a comfortable home free from any bad smells. \n\nDue to damage cased by animals...\n\nNo pets allowed.\n\nNo \u201cemotional support\u201d animals allowed!\n\nDue to medical reasons (health and safety concerns), we do not allow animals. I\u2019m very sorry. \n\nPets and \u201cemotional support\u201d animals will be removed immediately. No warnings. No exceptions. Zero tolerance policy.  \n\nTerms and Conditions under the Airbnb policy:\n \n\u201cHosts are allowed to decline the presence of emotional support animals from a stay or Experience.\u201d\n\nWe are not responsible for any injuries or the safety of any unauthorized animals because it\u2019s against the house rules. Please do not break the house rules. You will be evicted and trespassed from our property.\n\n\nHeath and Safety Concerns regarding Service Animals:\n\nAs a courtesy request, we ask if you wish to bring a service animal be disclosed in advance. Our in-house cleaner is highly allergic. We need to make special arrangements and schedule special deep cleaning services from an alternative source (in advance) because she will not be able to clean or re-enter the home until this is done. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated. We also wish to verify you are not attempting to bring a \u201cemotional support\u201d animal prior to your arrival. This will avoid sudden and immediate eviction if you misrepresent your pet as a Service Animal.\n\nPlease answer the following 2 questions if you haven\u2019t already:\n\n1) Is the assistance animal required because of a disability? \n \n2) What work or task has the animal been trained to perform? \n\n*** IMPORTANT ! NO \u201cEMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS ALLOWED ! ***\n\nOur local laws state it\u2019s an offence to represent a dog as a guide or service dog when it is not. A conviction carries a fine of up to $3,000\n\n \nWe have strict guidelines for those who wish to bring their Service Animal.\n \nA Service Animal staying on our property is NOT allowed to be left in the home alone at any time during your stay. This means not even left alone in a crate. You must take the animal with you anytime you leave the house. \n \nThe guest remains liable for any and all damage caused by a Service Animal. \n\nCompensation for any damages caused outside of normal \u201cwear and tear\u201d will be strictly enforced. \n \nYou and your Service Animal will be asked to leave if we discover misrepresentation of a pet as a Service Animal. We will report fraudulent claims of Service Animals to government authorities and will evict the guest(s) without further notice in such cases. If this occurs, there will be no right to a refund.\n \nBelow are some rules so both your stay and other guests after you will be enjoyable and relaxing:\n \n\u2022Your Service Dog may not be left unattended. (Crating and leaving the animal in your absence is not permitted; the animal must accompany you AT ALL TIMES).\n \n\u2022Please provide an advanced copy of your Service Animal rabies vaccine as well as a vaccination record showing all current vaccinations are current throughout your stay.\n \n\u2022Your Service Animal must be on a leash at all times, or under control of verbal or sight commands that they follow at all times.\n \n\u2022We will ask you to remove your Service Animal if the animal is out of control and the animal\u2019s handler does not take effective action to control it or if the animal is not housebroken. \n \n\u2022Please walk your Service Animal for bathroom needs. Indoor piddle pads are not allowed. \n \n\u2022Please clean up urinations/defecations immediately. Bring your own baggies and dispose in the large green trash cans OUTSIDE \n \n\u2022Service Animals may not be on furniture (sofa, chairs, bed or counters unless it is specifically needed for your disability.\n\n\u2022We are exempt from allowing \u201cemotional support\u201d animals! The tenant must possess documentation from a licensed health care practitioner stating the animal is required.\n\nAll owners should understand that a mere certificate, ID or registration bought online will not be enough to properly qualify their animal companion as service animal.\n\nAt check-out, a walk through will be done to ensure pets have not urinated or defecated in the home (clean it up if they have).  Even the best pets/animals get nervous away from home. Any excrement/urine/stain/damage left will result in forfeiture of deposit.\n\n* Service Animals. Exceptions can be made on the condition that a $5,000 damage deposit + $5,000 cleaning fee applies. This covers the cost of replacing all the furniture in the house and conducting a \u201cdeep clean\u201d of our house. We welcome all people, but this is a private home and not a commercial hotel. We reserve the right to change additional money for cleaning fees to compensate us for potential damage and odor removal. \n\n* We kindly ask to be a little bit more quiet late at night when using the kitchen or watching TV after 10:30 PM.  Other guests in the house might be sleeping at night...zzz Thank you kindly!\n\n* We guarantee our homes are sparking clean. If you are unhappy for any reason, please let us know. We promise to fix it. We wish you a happy and comfortable stay."]}

Please be accountable and respectful to neighbors if your windows are open.  You can of course watch late-night TV even at higher volumes, just be reasonable about it (there are concrete floors in the house to keep the noise down, so that helps and we generally cannot hear anything at all through the concrete floors).\n\nPlease be respectful to the property and prevent damage.  Please report damage or items needing fixing promptly so that I can arrange repairs as I want you to have a 5-star experience and for other guests after you.

You will be evicted and trespassed from our property.\n\n\nHeath and Safety Concerns regarding Service Animals:\n\nAs a courtesy request, we ask if you wish to bring a service animal be disclosed in advance. Our in-house cleaner is highly allergic. We need to make special arrangements and schedule special deep cleaning services from an alternative source (in advance) because she will not be able to clean or re-enter the home until this is done. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated. We also wish to verify you are not attempting to bring a \u201cemotional support\u201d animal prior to your arrival. This will avoid sudden and immediate eviction if you misrepresent your pet as a Service Animal.\n\nPlease answer the following 2 questions if you haven\u2019t already:\n\n1) Is the assistance animal required because of a disability? \n \n2) What work or task has the animal been trained to perform? \n\n*** IMPORTANT ! NO \u201cEMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS ALLOWED ! ***\n\nOur local laws state it\u2019s an offence to represent a dog as a guide or service dog when it is not. A conviction carries a fine of up to $3,000\n \nWe have strict guidelines for those who wish to bring their Service Animal.\n \nA Service Animal staying on our property is NOT allowed to be left in the home alone at any time during your stay. This means not even left alone in a crate. You must take the animal with you anytime you leave the house. \n \nThe guest remains liable for any and all damage caused by a Service Animal. \n\nCompensation for any damages caused outside of normal \u201cwear and tear\u201d will be strictly enforced. \n \nYou and your Service Animal will be asked to leave if we discover misrepresentation of a pet as a Service Animal. We will report fraudulent claims of Service Animals to government authorities and will evict the guest(s) without further notice in such cases. If this occurs, there will be no right to a refund.\n \nBelow are some rules so both your stay and other guests after you will be enjoyable and relaxing:\n \n\u2022Your Service Dog may not be left unattended. (Crating and leaving the animal in your absence is not permitted; the animal must accompany you AT ALL TIMES).\n \n\u2022Please provide an advanced copy of your Service Animal rabies vaccine as well as a vaccination record showing all current vaccinations are current throughout your stay.\n \n\u2022Your Service Animal must be on a leash at all times, or under control of verbal or sight commands that they follow at all times.\n \n\u2022We will ask you to remove your Service Animal if the animal is out of control and the animal\u2019s handler does not take effective action to control it or if the animal is not housebroken. \n \n\u2022Please walk your Service Animal for bathroom needs. Indoor piddle pads are not allowed. \n \n\u2022Please clean up urinations/defecations immediately. Bring your own baggies and dispose in the large green trash cans OUTSIDE \n \n\u2022Service Animals may not be on furniture (sofa, chairs, bed or counters unless it is specifically needed for your disability.\n\n\u2022We are exempt from allowing \u201cemotional support\u201d animals! The tenant must possess documentation from a licensed health care practitioner stating the animal is required.\n\nAll owners should understand that a mere certificate, ID or registration bought online will not be enough to properly qualify their animal companion as service animal.\n\nAt check-out, a walk through will be done to ensure pets have not urinated or defecated in the home (clean it up if they have).  Even the best pets/animals get nervous away from home. Any excrement/urine/stain/damage left will result in forfeiture of deposit.\n\n* Service Animals. Exceptions can be made on the condition that a $5,000 damage deposit + $5,000 cleaning fee applies. This covers the cost of replacing all the furniture in the house and conducting a \u201cdeep clean\u201d of our house. We welcome all people, but this is a private home and not a commercial hotel. We reserve the right to change additional money for cleaning fees to compensate us for potential damage and odor removal. \n\n* We kindly ask to be a little bit more quiet late at night when using the kitchen or watching TV after 10:30 PM.  Other guests in the house might be sleeping at night...zzz Thank you kindly!\n\n* We guarantee our homes are sparking clean. If you are unhappy for any reason, please let us know.

Failure to do so will result in termination of your reservation and no refund. \n\n2.

Please note that I only hand keys/provide access to the person who booked the reservation and you must show valid picture ID upon request. \n\n4. All guests must be accounted for in the reservation. This means all guests entering the residence/building at any point in time counts as a guest--in other words, the definition of a guest is not limited to only those people planning on sleeping inside the unit, but to all guests planning to be inside the unit at any given time.\n\nFor example, if 8 people are going to \"hang out\" inside the unit, but only 2 people plan on sleeping over, then the guest count selected during the booking should be \"8\" not \"2\". Any extra guests not disclosed before arrival will lead to an immediate termination of the reservation and full charge of a damage deposit.\n\n5. Strictly NO parties/events/loud music. If this rule is not followed, you will be immediately removed from the unit and charged a $1000+ fee. \n\n6.

No excessive noise or loud music. Quiet hours start at 10:00pm. If any noise complaints are reported by neighbours or building management more than two times, a full security deposit of $1000 will be charged and you will be immediately removed from the unit without refund. \n\n10. Please ensure to check-out on time in order to avoid a $100 late check-out fee--I need to have my cleaners clean the unit on time for the next guest to check-in. If you require an earlier check-in or a later check-out please request it in advance and I will do my best to accommodate you. Unless otherwise discussed, any guest who is still in the residence/building after 11pm will be charged for an extra $50 per hour.

You will be evicted and trespassed from our property.\n\n\nHeath and Safety Concerns regarding Service Animals:\n\nAs a courtesy request, we ask if you wish to bring a service animal be disclosed in advance. Our in-house cleaner is highly allergic. We need to make special arrangements and schedule special deep cleaning services from an alternative source (in advance) because she will not be able to clean or re-enter the home until this is done. Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated. We also wish to verify you are not attempting to bring a \u201cemotional support\u201d animal prior to your arrival. This will avoid sudden and immediate eviction if you misrepresent your pet as a Service Animal.\n\nPlease answer the following 2 questions if you haven\u2019t already:\n\n1) Is the assistance animal required because of a disability? \n \n2) What work or task has the animal been trained to perform? \n\n*** IMPORTANT ! NO \u201cEMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS ALLOWED ! ***\n\nOur local laws state it\u2019s an offence to represent a dog as a guide or service dog when it is not. A conviction carries a fine of up to $3,000.\n \nWe have strict guidelines for those who wish to bring their Service Animal.\n \nA Service Animal staying on our property is NOT allowed to be left in the home alone at any time during your stay. This means not even left alone in a crate. You must take the animal with you anytime you leave the house. \n \nThe guest remains liable for any and all damage caused by a Service Animal. \n\nCompensation for any damages caused outside of normal \u201cwear and tear\u201d will be strictly enforced. \n \nYou and your Service Animal will be asked to leave if we discover misrepresentation of a pet as a Service Animal. We will report fraudulent claims of Service Animals to government authorities and will evict the guest(s) without further notice in such cases. If this occurs, there will be no right to a refund.\n \nBelow are some rules so both your stay and other guests after you will be enjoyable and relaxing:\n \n\u2022Your Service Dog may not be left unattended. (Crating and leaving the animal in your absence is not permitted; the animal must accompany you AT ALL TIMES).\n \n\u2022Please provide an advanced copy of your Service Animal rabies vaccine as well as a vaccination record showing all current vaccinations are current throughout your stay.\n \n\u2022Your Service Animal must be on a leash at all times, or under control of verbal or sight commands that they follow at all times.\n \n\u2022We will ask you to remove your Service Animal if the animal is out of control and the animal\u2019s handler does not take effective action to control it or if the animal is not housebroken. \n \n\u2022Please walk your Service Animal for bathroom needs. Indoor piddle pads are not allowed. \n \n\u2022Please clean up urinations/defecations immediately. Bring your own baggies and dispose in the large green trash cans OUTSIDE \n \n\u2022Service Animals may not be on furniture (sofa, chairs, bed or counters unless it is specifically needed for your disability.\n\n\u2022We are exempt from allowing \u201cemotional support\u201d animals! The tenant must possess documentation from a licensed health care practitioner stating the animal is required.\n\nAll owners should understand that a mere certificate, ID or registration bought online will not be enough to properly qualify their animal companion as service animal.\n\nAt check-out, a walk through will be done to ensure pets have not urinated or defecated in the home (clean it up if they have).  Even the best pets/animals get nervous away from home. Any excrement/urine/stain/damage left will result in forfeiture of deposit.\n\n* Service Animals. Exceptions can be made on the condition that a $5,000 damage deposit + $5,000 cleaning fee applies. This covers the cost of replacing all the furniture in the house and conducting a \u201cdeep clean\u201d of our house. We welcome all people, but this is a private home and not a commercial hotel. We reserve the right to change additional money for cleaning fees to compensate us for potential damage and odor removal. \n\n* We kindly ask to be a little bit more quiet late at night when using the kitchen or watching TV after 10:30 PM.

This includes all Airbnb guests as well. If you throw a party, trash the space, damage the unit, disrespect the property, or have a gathering with extra guests that are not reported in your initial booking, you are breaking the rules and will be fined $200.\n\nCLEANING\nOur cleaning fee is based on a courteous guest (e.g. someone who cleans up after themselves, puts dishes in the dishwasher, towels in the washer, leaves the place as they found it, etc.). This is NOT a hotel. If the housekeeping crew discovers an unreasonable mess post-checkout, we will charge an additional fee of $100.\n\nEXTRA TOWELS/LINENS\nPlease understand and accept that our housekeeping crew needs to cover a great number of units per day and within a short window of time.
