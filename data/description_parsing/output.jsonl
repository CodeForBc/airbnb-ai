I actually live here, but find myself not always needing the space. Renting it out helps pay the bills while I focus on my artistic career. <br /><br />When I travel, I'm naturally flexible, but really appreciate knowing the nature of the place I'm staying at. I think my place is great, but it might not be for everybody, so I'll try and describe it as best I can. I'd prefer only happy tenants rather than a few extra rentals. If you have any concerns or questions, please reach out before hand.<br /><br />**For July and August rentals: The suite can be warm, and does not have air conditioning (I've tried, but it's too big a space for what can be installed). There are fans, and the balcony windows open wide.<br /><br />As it's my home, there are some signs it's lived in, it's not a sterile suite. I try and stay as professional and minimal as possible however. The space also functions as my showcase studio for my woodworking and steel fabrications (There are some products on display and available for sale). The suite has fairly constant changes, so it's hard to keep up with the photography. You might find a different coffee table, project waiting to be sold, or general home improvement. Rest assured, these things will be tucked away as much as possible and shouldn't affect your stay. <br /><br />Largest issue for staying here would be the possibility of street noise, as it is an urban location. With the balcony door closed, the noise in the suite is minimal. Opening the balcony door brings in the fresh air and also the sounds of traffic. <br /><br />The space is a 700 sq foot studio. Queen size bed, WiFi, 60\" television, Amazon Firestick, Netflix, and full kitchen (no microwave). The aesthetic is warm and minimalist. The floor is concrete.

While things may seem (and look) dodgy, you will find the residents, despite being 'rough around the edges', to be generally friendly.  <br />If you think that someone's low socio-economic status makes them a danger to you, then you should not stay here.

Do not smoke in the courtyard.  I will get a hefty fine, which means you will get a hefty fine ($500).  Yes, the no-smoking includes vaping, e-cigs, weed, cigarettes, cigars etc. <br /><br />PETS: I prefer no pets, but you can always ask! <br /><br />KIDS:  My place is not kid-proof.

VERY IMPORTANT note about local regulation on short-term rental:   <br /><br />Other FAQs:<br /><br />1. Why the booking is request only?<br /><br />At this moment, due to our local regulation, I can not openly hosting frequently, so there is limited availability, and longer term is preferred because of our short-term rental regulation. <br /><br />When you sent me quest, please briefly describe why you are booking etc, because this is a shared space with me and my daughter, we want to make sure everyone has a good time and have the right expectations.<br /><br />2. Do I have the whole condo or just one room?<br /><br />My home is listed as \"private room\" (plus private bathroom), not \"entire place\". My entire home is a two bedrooms and two bathrooms corner unit in a high-rise condo with breathtaking corner-view. The layout of my condo is that the two rooms and bathroom are separated by a living room, so there is some distance between guest room and the other Master bedroom. Usually me and my daughter live together in another room, we have lived here for several years. In some case we might be travelling and we might rent our room out, so it can be other tenant living in the other room. My home is best fit for those who seek for a safe and nice stay, don't mind sharing and like the view and convenient location in a family-oriented environment and in a convenient location. Most guests had good experience as you can see from my reviews. This is a beautiful home and I like to share with guests.<br /><br />3. Is there free parking?<br /><br />I didn't list my space with free parking, free parking is not guaranteed but possible. (We have free visitor parking, but it's first come first serve and you can only use maximum 3-days in a roll, so it depends on the availability and the length of your stay.) There are free parking on street in the evening too, but a bit far and also depends on the availability. <br /><br />Paid parking is always available with reasonable price, and it's very convenient in the underground of our building. If you stay long term and need parking everyday, you can buy monthly parking pass. My home has very convenient public transit nearby.<br /><br />4. Can I invite my friends?<br /><br />Yes, but only one or two small group, no big party, no loud music, and overnight stay can only be maximum 2 people, and quiet time after 10pm and basic cleaning after your gathering.<br /><br />5. Can I smoke?<br /><br />No, smoking are banned in this whole building,  you can not smoke on balcony either.<br /><br />6. Is there breakfast?<br /><br />Usually self-serving breakfast, e.g.cereals, milk, coffee and tea is available, you can request more if needed. I find most guests buy their own food, but with request and extra fees I am happy to cook breakfast for you, :)<br /><br />I love hosting, I love meeting new people, I welcome guests from all over the world, men or women, LGBTs, all ages.

I actually live here, but find myself not always needing the space.

Queen size bed, WiFi, 60\" television, Amazon Firestick, Netflix, and full kitchen (no microwave). The aesthetic is warm and minimalist. The floor is concrete.
