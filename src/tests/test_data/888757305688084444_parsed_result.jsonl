Although we did soundproof the place through the renovation, you will hear them running around upstairs. They are normally in bed between 9pm and 6am.  They might be running around the backyard in the summer, and use the trampoline as well. If you are looking for a very quiet place, our suite might not be the right place.<br /><br />We love mountain biking, skiing, and pretty much most outdoor sports. We came here and stayed because of the lifestyle and happily share our knowledge and provide any tips or what to do/"}
